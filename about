I did my higher secondary in Pasang Lhahamu Sherpa Memorial College and I completed my Bachelors in Major English in the same college which is affiliated to Tribhuvan University. In addition I had also done diploma courses in Graphic and Multimedia Courses. At the period when I was doing bachelor I decided to’ get my feet wet’ and started working as a Graphic designer and I learned many things in my work.
Japan stands as a safe, multicultural, friendly and harmonious society. Japan values the wealth of cultural diversity and social sophistication that nation linter students bring to the campuses and communities. Completing my Master program in Japan will equip me with a recognized degree along with global experience which will certainly offer me a great deal of avenues for furthering my career in Information Technology and help me to achieve a bright future.

After the completion of your master degree program, I plan to return Nepal and work for reputed IT companies and later on I can establish myself as a successful entrepreneur in IT sector in Nepal. Your master program in Information Technology will enable me to achieve the goals I have set for myself. I expect to have a long career in this field and benefit a wide range of IT companies in my country. In this way, I hope to add to the general development of my country’s economy and become a leading professional in my field.
